#Machine Learning on Spark

Implementation of Machine Learning examples in Spark for the Coursera course - <https://www.coursera.org/course/ml>

##Octave Implementation

The implementation of the same examples in Octave is also available at <https://github.com/everpeace/ml-class-assignments>. This README file consists of how to run different examples.

##How to run?

###Linear Regression

Run the main function com.zinnia.ml.spark.ex1_linear_regression.Ex1.main()
This is an example for single variable Linear Regression.
Dataset for this example is src/main/resources/ex1_linear_regression/ex1data1.txt

Run the main function com.zinnia.ml.spark.ex1_linear_regression.Ex1_Multi.main()
This is an example for multiple variable Linear Regression
Dataset for this example is src/main/resources/ex1_linear_regression/ex1data2.txt

###Logistic Regression

Run the main function com.zinnia.ml.spark.ex2_logistic_regression.Ex2_Data1.main()
This is an example for single variable Linear Regression.
Dataset for this example is src/main/resources/ex2_logistic_regression/ex2data1.txt

Run the main function com.zinnia.ml.spark.ex2_logistic_regression.Ex2_Data2_Poly.main()
This is an example for single variable Linear Regression.
Dataset for this example is src/main/resources/ex2_logistic_regression/ex2data2.txt

Run the main function com.zinnia.ml.spark.ex3_multiclass_classification.Ex3_Data4.main()
This is an example for single variable Linear Regression.
Dataset for this example is src/main/resources/ex3_multiclass_classification/ex3data1.csv

###K-Means Clustering

Run the main function com.zinnia.ml.spark.ex7_k_means_clustering.ex7_Data2.main()
This is an example for single variable Linear Regression.
Dataset for this example is src/main/resources/ex7_k_means_clustering/ex7data2.txt

Run the main function com.zinnia.ml.spark.ex7_k_means_clustering.ex7_Bird_small.main()
This is an example for single variable Linear Regression.
Dataset for this example is src/main/resources/ex7_k_means_clustering/bird_data.txt

###Principal Component Anaylysis

Run the main function com.zinnia.ml.spark.ex7_pca.ex7_pca_data1.main()
This is an example for single variable Linear Regression.
Dataset for this example is src/main/resources/ex7_pca_data/ex7data1.txt
